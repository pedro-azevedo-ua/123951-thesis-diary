# Weekly report  - 22/09/2025 - 05/10/2025

## What was done

- During this 2 weeks I started to write the concept with a context, a problem and a possible solution ([concept.md](./../../docs/identification-phase/concept.md)).

- Analysed the paper [Modeling the Mobile Application Development
Lifecycle](./../../docs/MADLC/IMECS2014_pp596-600.pdf) and wrote an analysis in [mobile-app-development-cycle.md](./../../docs/MADLC/mobile-app-development-cycle.md). This is similar to the Software Development Lifecycle. Identify some tasks to complete each phase, and created a Trello board with them ([trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/68d3b7e1f70108f3e84fd107/ATTI8a96d42e8f97bd1eaa12fa743a6a4bd7D8EF7D9F/the-playground)).

- Started a competitor analysis, still needs some refinement. ([competitor-analyisis.md](./../../docs/identification-phase/competitor-analysis.md))

- Inicial analysis on the survey, still want more answers. ([reserch-analysis](./../../docs/identification-phase/research-analysis.md))

- Started to read a book about kotlin multiplatform _Kotlin in Depth_ from Thopmson Carter and wrote about kotlin multiplatform. ([kotlin-multiplatform.md](./../../docs/design-phase/kotlin-multiplatform.md))

- Search some papers to start doing a better state of the technology.
